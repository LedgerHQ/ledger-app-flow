## Generate merkle tree files from manifest files
```
nvm use 16.10.0
cd tree
yarn run generate
cd ..
cd tests
yarn run generate
cd ..
```

This produces
- `txMerkleTree.js` to be used in JS client. 
- `txMerkleTree.mjs` used by the second yarn command. 
- `txMerkleTree.py` to be used in Python client.
- `testvectors/manifestPayloadCases.json`  to be used in manifest tests. Further files may be used for testing purposes in the future. They were used by hard to maintain unit tests in C++ before.

```
cp txMerkleTree.py ../tests/application_client/
cp testvectors/manifestPayloadCases.json ../tests/
cp txMerkleTree.js ../js/src
```

Depending on what you do with the JS sources, you may need to rebuild them.

Finally, you need to enter the root hash from `txMerkleTree.* files` (it should be the same in all files) to merkleTreeRoot variable `../src/from tx_metadata.c`

As the next step you need to fix speculos tests. 
You will need to generate new snapshots for the speculos tests.

You may probably need to fix some tests. Most notably `test_transaction_metadata_errors` and `test_transaction_slot`.
In the future we may jugde to add some fake transactions for testing into merkle tree to make the tests more stable.

Similarly, js tests may need to fix script hash and expected APDU sequence.
